It is a great collection of professionals, phd students, masters students, and undergrads, specializing in the synthesis of optics and liquid crystals. The physics of liquid crystals interests us for many reasons, both with its controllability in some cases to produce useful optical effects, as well as its chaotic structure which allows us to explore turbulence. We are working on projects like arbitrary matrix multiplication, post-turbulence reconstruction, and optical-systems-on-a-chip fabrication. My project in particular is an extension of my advisor's phd work, linked below. He has shown that optical reservoir computing has some effectiveness at predicting a 1D chaotic simulation, and has experimentally verified the runtime advantages. My work (with my co-researcher Vahagn), aims to go steps further. We want to predict actual chaos (liquid crystals), not simply simulated data. This work involves understanding and exploration of liquid crystal physics, data manipulation strategies, chaotic systems analysis for metrics, and general machine learning techniques. In addition to our main goal of implementing an optical reservoir computer for real chaotic data, I am also looking into ways we can formalize/standardize these often vague chaotic machine learning challenges, and working a lot in simulation. We also ran a 10 day summer camp for university students introducing liquid crystal experimental optics, with theory and experiments.",

I worked under an NDA so I cannot divulge all the information about my time there. I created from scratch a data processing pipeline and the associated software, also inventing metrics for quantifying progress. This was a difficult problem, as the assumptions we could put on the data were small and varying rapidly, so I needed to create a flexible framework, that would last them as long as possible, anticipating future development of the prototype. At the same time, I was involved with the physical design & logistics. We had a small technical team of the CTO, a mechanical engineer, myself, and electrical engineering + physics contracters. So we all had to wear multiple hats and collaborate across topics. It was an amazing technical team and we did our best, but I really got to see how important it is to have a good balance - and clear lines of communication between - the technical and business sides.

It is easy to toggle this on or off, depending on what you want to work on that day. The studying is automated, different cards will be retrieved at different rates dependent on your success. When a card is retired, it will be reintroduced after a period to make sure you did not forget. Lastly, there are social aspects, where you can collaborate on topics/collections.

This is in response to the numerous attempts to engineer Ulaanbaatar out of its coal-dependence and horrible air quality, that have failed miserably due to not taking into consideration the human factors - the side notes that are much more important than we often realize. In the fall of 2022 I took an Anthro-Engineering course, where we studied general anthropology, Mongolian anthropology, systems thinking, and engineering ideas for tackling the complex problem. My final paper is below: where we were tasked to each propose different interventions. The initial idea was to use a molten salt heat brick, heated by waste heat, and transported to the homes, in order to reduce on site coal burning. However, there are many logistical difficulties, and everyone is keeping an open mind about all the different potential avenues for change. In January, when temperatures regularly reach -40, we travelled to Mongolia for 10 days, meeting with stakeholders (government officials, entrepreneurs, community leaders, ger residents), and designing an experimental setup with the students there. In the spring, we continued to iterate the design with the help of increasing data, and maintained an ongoing collaboration with the MUST students.",

      "main_caption": "I was attracted to this fantasy game growing up due to the evident simplicity of a weekly decision problem that is extraordinarily complex. The essence of the game is you have a certain amount of money and you need to pick a team of 15 players, based on positions, and each has a price, which evolves over the year based on supply and demand of other users in the game. Each week you can make 1 change, sell and buy, or you can save your change up and have 2 for the next week. Each week you decide 11/15 to get points from that week, and also a captain to get 2x. There are also special 'chips' that you can use once, such as 'wildcard' where you can change your whole team, or triple captain where you get 3x instead of 2x. People have come up with many different strategies, and I tried my brain at it for a while and did pretty well. Some people like to use statistics, some think they pick up on intangibles about players potential by watching live. But, growing up with alphaZero, and AI always at the front of my mind, I believed that there was sufficient information in the data to outperform the humans. I wrote the main chunk during sleepless nights over the fall of 2020, and by 2021, it was fully automated (now there is a small active human component due to anti-bot measures with the front-end). It has been a super interesting challenge, requiring data engineering, modeling, coming up with decision/planning methods, search algorithms, and managing state. The modeling was chosen to be RandomForestRegression with the idea of mapping a current player to many similar past players, and since it was the easiest to start with. However, given some more time, I would like to use neural networks, and remove my algorithms for decision from point projection, and learn the game end to end. Already though, it is performing very respectably, finishing typically around 10% of all players (and this is with some severe handicaps right now). Furthermore, I know it has some promise, because it consistantly finds impressive sleepers, its main fault is making silly mistakes that all experienced humans know are fallacious.",
