I set out to solve 2 main problems with other apps like Goodnotes or Quizlet: (1) Input time should be as small as possible (2) The user should not have to worry about inventing/managing the study process. The result is a cross-platform app that has multiple card input methods. The data organization is intuitive, with groupings of topics, which can be studied simultaneously in collections. It is easy to toggle this on or off, depending on what you want to work on that day. The studying is automated, different cards will be retrieved at different rates dependent on your success. When a card is retired, it will be reintroduced after a period to make sure you did not forget. Lastly, there are social aspects, where you can collaborate on topics/collections. It is currently being beta-tested by family and close friends.",
